# Covid-19-Image-Classification


In this work, we have created a customized dataset which is having three categories, normal,
covid and viral pneumonia. We have also transformed the images so that the images are of the
same size and same position for training and testing. Training set consists of around 2500
images while the testing set consists of 240 images for each category. We compared different
deep learning models in the research work and accordingly presented a literature review of
different papers which are related to the COVID-19 Image Classification. We have used
different models on the images for classification and according to our findings the optimal
classification method for this dataset is proposed Resnet-18 model. For evaluation, we took
accuracy as the parameter.
